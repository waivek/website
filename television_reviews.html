                    <h3>Visuals</h3>
                    <p>Gorgeous still life drawings during Grisha’s flashback.</p>

                    <h3>Writing</h3>
                    <p>Titan’s that appeared in the first episode of the series were shown to have originated in this
                    episode. The Smiling Titan is Grisha’s first wife. Her eating Grisha’s second wife (Eren’s mother)
                    is now a poetic and haunting scene, adding to the horror the viewer felt the first time watching the
                    scene.</p>

                    <p>The Marley reveal makes Reiner, Bertholdt and Annie’s cloudy motivations now seem more
                    reasonable. All the revelations fit neatly into the events that had happened in the show and don't
                    contradict any plot devices or character motivations.</p>

                    <p>Ymir’s OVA which seemed confusing also fits neatly into the episode. Seemingly independent
                    episodes are now connected and are important to the overall structure of the show.</p>

                    <p>Grisha’s origin also makes sense. He seems to appear outside the walls and the viewer is tricked
                    into thinking that he was a wall resident who accidentally escaped.</p>

                    <h3>Overall</h3>
                    <p>Small scenes throughout the series now have very different tones in terms of how the viewer will
                    watch them going back. Every character’s arc was meticulously written out by Isayama and each of
                    them has an effect on the overall story. By telling the character perspective’s non-linearly and
                    using Eren’s fading memories to do so is a stroke of genius. We avoid the flashback trope in favour
                    of something that makes more sense.</p>
