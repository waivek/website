                            <p>Gorgeous still life drawings during Grisha’s flashback.</p>

                            <h3>Writing</h3>
                            <p>Titan’s that appeared in the first episode of the series were shown to have originated in
                            this episode. The Smiling Titan is Grisha’s first wife. Her eating Grisha’s second wife (Eren’s
                            mother) is now a poetic and haunting scene, adding to the horror the viewer felt the first time
                            watching the scene.</p>

                            <p>The Marley reveal makes Reiner, Bertholdt and Annie’s cloudy motivations now seem more
                            reasonable. All the revelations fit neatly into the events that had happened in the show and
                            don't contradict any plot devices or character motivations.</p>

                            <p>Ymir’s OVA which seemed confusing also fits neatly into the episode. Seemingly independent
                            episodes are now connected and are important to the overall structure of the show.</p>

                            <p>Grisha’s origin also makes sense. He seems to appear outside the walls and the viewer is
                            tricked into thinking that he was a wall resident who accidentally escaped.</p>

                            <h3>Overall</h3>
                            <p>Small scenes throughout the series now have very different tones in terms of how the viewer
                            will watch them going back. Every character’s arc was meticulously written out by Isayama and
                            each of them has an effect on the overall story. By telling the character perspective’s
                            non-linearly and using Eren’s fading memories to do so is a stroke of genius. We avoid the
                            flashback trope in favour of something that makes more sense.</p>

                            <p>The galaxy image used in Ymir’s flashback gets thematic significance. The coordinate
                            represents all the memory paths of all the Eldian’s. It is the intersection of these paths.
                            Ymir’s flashback has a galaxy image, however even that has an intersection.</p>

                            <h3>Writing</h3>

                            <p>Dina Fritz is the Smiling Titan. This reveal serves to explain why Eren was able to control
                            the titans in 2x12. According to the current rules of the world, only a descendant of royal
                            blood can wield the Founding Titan’s powers. Eren was able to do it the moment he punched the
                            Smiling Titan, despite not possessing royal blood. This is written off as him activating his
                            power’s due to his heightened emotional state and a desire to survive. However, Isayama’s deft
                            writing gives a proper explanation and closes any plausible loopholes in this portion of the
                            story.</p>

                            <p>A user on reddit pointed out the significance of the reveal that Titan wielder’s can live for
                            only 13 years.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Finally, they adapted the chapter where the Curse of Ymir was first mentioned, or the
                                thirteen-year remaining lifespan curse.</p>

                                <p>For those who have not seen some discussions on how the number 13 is significant, lets do
                                some math:</p>

                                <p>From the narrations in season 1 and the history books shown, around 100 years ago
                                (specifically, 107 years from chapter 2 of the manga), the first ruler of the Walls,
                                King Fritz the 145th created the walls to protect humanity.</p>

                                <p>When a someone gains a titan power, their remaining lifespan is set to 13 years due
                                to “Ymir’s Curse”. Same number of years between the royal family’s succesion
                                ritual.</p>

                                <p>“145th king” means there have been 145 wielders of the Founding Titan at that time.
                                145 x 13 = 1885. So 107 years ago, it has been 1885 years from Ymir Fritz.</p>

                                <p>At present time (1885 + 107) it would be 1992 years since Ymir Fritz.</p>

                                <p>Eren got his titan power at age 10, he’s supposed to die when he’s 23. Currently,
                                Eren is 15 and has around 8 years left to live.</p>

                                <p>1992 + 8 = 2000</p>


                                <p>What was the title of the first episode again? Oh yeah, “To you, in 2000 years.” No
                                biggie, nothing to see here.</p>

                                    From the reddit discussion of this episode on the /r/anime subreddit.

                            <p>Dialogue repetition also has thematic significance. In 1x9, the dialogue used is “If you want
                            to save Mikasa, Armin and everyone else,”. In this episode, the dialogue used was the same in
                            the ED credits.</p>

                            The volume of the background music is used as a vehicle to convey the mood. For triump
                            or big reveals, the music’s volume reaches a crescendo, then reduces as the scene
                            continues.

                            musical choice (“You don’t mess around with Jim”) and his uncharacteristic clapping made
                            me feel what he felt.

                            when they meet, the increased volume with the goofy music encourages a goofy, happy
                            feeling.

                            Loved the scene with Billy and Eleven. The emotion’s felt earned. Loved the connection
                            between them and how tenderly Eleven held Billy’s cheek. Billy standing up in super-hero
                            fashion to the Mind Flayer was amazing.

                            <p>Hughie is similar to Izuku Midoriya from <em>Boku no Hero Academia</em>. He starts off as a weak-will person who “has no fight”, according to his father. By the end of the season, he saves Mother’s Milk and Frenchie with a plan, while Butcher is consumed by vengeance for Homelander. He also holds life sacred. In the finale, A-Train has a heart attack. Hughie saves him, even though A-Train killed his girlfriend.</p>
                            <p>Homelander was the highlight of the series. His oedipus complex slowly shows itself and is at the centre of the show. He was raised by lab scientists and views Madelyn as his maternal authority but also lusts after her. He is competent, and single-handedly uncovers Hughie and co. and burns their identities, forcing them to go on the run. He is completely callous about human life. He is similar to Killmonger from <em>Jessica Jones</em>, in how out of touch he is with reality and how he can’t have a human connection with anybody. He referst to normal humans as “mud people”, because they don’t have superpowers.</p>
                            <p>Butcher’s character arc was well-done. His motivations are only revealed half-way through the season but make his actions seem understandable. Homelander raping his wife is his driving force and reason for seeking vengeance.</p>
                            <p>Butcher and Homelander’s story arcs converging was excellent writing. Butcher’s wish becomes a Monkeys Paw. Homelander gets what he always wanted, a family and Butcher is hit with the knowledge that his wife is alive and has fathered a child of Homelander, which is a reality far worse than the one Butcher had believed he was in. Butcher’s hate for superheroes is stoked as the love of his life has fathered a super child</p>
