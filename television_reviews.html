                        <h3>Visuals</h3>
                        <p>Gorgeous still life drawings during Grisha’s flashback.</p>

                        <h3>Writing</h3>
                        <p>Titan’s that appeared in the first episode of the series were shown to have originated in
                        this episode. The Smiling Titan is Grisha’s first wife. Her eating Grisha’s second wife (Eren’s
                        mother) is now a poetic and haunting scene, adding to the horror the viewer felt the first time
                        watching the scene.</p>

                        <p>The Marley reveal makes Reiner, Bertholdt and Annie’s cloudy motivations now seem more
                        reasonable. All the revelations fit neatly into the events that had happened in the show and
                        don't contradict any plot devices or character motivations.</p>

                        <p>Ymir’s OVA which seemed confusing also fits neatly into the episode. Seemingly independent
                        episodes are now connected and are important to the overall structure of the show.</p>

                        <p>Grisha’s origin also makes sense. He seems to appear outside the walls and the viewer is
                        tricked into thinking that he was a wall resident who accidentally escaped.</p>

                        <h3>Overall</h3>
                        <p>Small scenes throughout the series now have very different tones in terms of how the viewer
                        will watch them going back. Every character’s arc was meticulously written out by Isayama and
                        each of them has an effect on the overall story. By telling the character perspective’s
                        non-linearly and using Eren’s fading memories to do so is a stroke of genius. We avoid the
                        flashback trope in favour of something that makes more sense.</p>

                        <h3>Visuals</h3>

                        <p>The galaxy image used in Ymir’s flashback gets thematic significance. The coordinate
                        represents all the memory paths of all the Eldian’s. It is the intersection of these paths.
                        Ymir’s flashback has a galaxy image, however even that has an intersection.</p>

                        <h3>Writing</h3>

                        <p>Dina Fritz is the Smiling Titan. This reveal serves to explain why Eren was able to control
                        the titans in 2x12. According to the current rules of the world, only a descendant of royal
                        blood can wield the Founding Titan’s powers. Eren was able to do it the moment he punched the
                        Smiling Titan, despite not possessing royal blood. This is written off as him activating his
                        power’s due to his heightened emotional state and a desire to survive. However, Isayama’s deft
                        writing gives a proper explanation and closes any plausible loopholes in this portion of the
                        story.</p>

                        <p>A user on reddit pointed out the significance of the reveal that Titan wielder’s can live for
                        only 13 years.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Finally, they adapted the chapter where the Curse of Ymir was first mentioned, or the
                            thirteen-year remaining lifespan curse.</p>

                            <p>For those who have not seen some discussions on how the number 13 is significant, lets do
                            some math:</p>

                            <p>From the narrations in season 1 and the history books shown, around 100 years ago
                            (specifically, 107 years from chapter 2 of the manga), the first ruler of the Walls,
                            King Fritz the 145th created the walls to protect humanity.</p>

                            <p>When a someone gains a titan power, their remaining lifespan is set to 13 years due
                            to “Ymir’s Curse”. Same number of years between the royal family’s succesion
                            ritual.</p>

                            <p>“145th king” means there have been 145 wielders of the Founding Titan at that time.
                            145 x 13 = 1885. So 107 years ago, it has been 1885 years from Ymir Fritz.</p>

                            <p>At present time (1885 + 107) it would be 1992 years since Ymir Fritz.</p>

                            <p>Eren got his titan power at age 10, he’s supposed to die when he’s 23. Currently,
                            Eren is 15 and has around 8 years left to live.</p>

                            <p>1992 + 8 = 2000</p>


                            <p>What was the title of the first episode again? Oh yeah, “To you, in 2000 years.” No
                            biggie, nothing to see here.</p>

                        <p>Dialogue repetition also has thematic significance. In 1x9, the dialogue used is “If you want
                        to save Mikasa, Armin and everyone else,”. In this episode, the dialogue used was the same in
                        the ED credits.</p>
