            <h1>Theology - Desktop</h1>
<p>
Theology is the critical study of the nature of the 
<!--a onmouseover = "showcard('#h_divinity',this)"
   onmouseout  = "hidecard('#h_divinity') ">divine</a-->
<a href="#h_divinity">divine</a>.
It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries.[1]</p>
<p> Theology is basically the study of deities or their 
<a href="#h_scripture">scriptures</a>
in order to
discover what they have revealed about themselves. While theology has turned into a
secular field, religion followers still consider theology as a discipline that helps
them live and understand concepts such as life, love and helps them lead a life of
obedience to the deities they follow or worship.[3]</p>

<p> The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as
old as the history of such institutions themselves. For instance, Taxila was an
early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th century BC or earlier;[37] the
Platonic Academy founded in Athens in the 4th century BC seems to have included
theological themes in its subject matter;[38] the Chinese Taixue delivered Confucian
teaching from the 2nd century BC;[39] the School of Nisibis was a centre of
Christian learning from the 4th century AD;[40][41] Nalanda in India was a site of
Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD;[42] and the
Moroccan University of Al-Karaouine was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th
century,[43] as was Al-Azhar University in Cairo.[44]</p>

<p> The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by
papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible,
however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare,
with the University of Paris being an exception.[45] Later they were also founded by
Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian
University in Krak√≥w) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne,
University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were
founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have
become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities
and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by
monasteries.[46] Christian theological learning was therefore a component in these
institutions, as was the study of Church or Canon law: universities played an
important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church
pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal
rights of the church over against secular rulers.[47] At such universities,
theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church:
it fed, and was fed by, practices of preaching, prayer and celebration of the
Mass.[48]</p>

<p> During the High Middle Ages, theology was therefore the ultimate subject at
universities, being named "The Queen of the Sciences" and serving as the capstone to
the Trivium and Quadrivium that young men were expected to study. This meant that
the other subjects (including Philosophy) existed primarily to help with theological
thought.[49]</p>

<p> Christian theology's preeminent place in the university began to be challenged
during the European Enlightenment, especially in Germany.[50] Other subjects gained
in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place of a
discipline that seemed to involve commitment to the authority of particular
religious traditions in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted
to independent reason.[51]</p>

<p> Since the early nineteenth century, various different approaches have emerged in
the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning
theology's place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum
centres on whether theology's methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly
speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a
pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment
conflicts with academic freedom.[52]</p>

        <h3>Divinity</h3>
            <p>In religion, divinity or godhead is the state of things that are
            believed to come from a supernatural power or deity, such as a god,
            supreme being, creator deity, or spirits, and are therefore
            regarded as sacred and holy.</p>
