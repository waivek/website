        <h1>Stripe - Strategy, Culture & Hiring</h1>

        <p>
            The CEO of Stripe seems like a genuinely good guy. He places a lot
            of emphasis on the culture at Stripe and seems to have attracted
            people who deeply care about their craft. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            The website stripe.com is
            a clear indicator of how passionate the people working on it are. It
            is also supposedly a very small team of 4 designers. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a hobby.

<h2>Blitzscaling 11: Patrick Collison on Hiring at Stripe and the Role of a Product-Focused CEO</h2>

<p class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrDZhAxpKrQ</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">00:20:00</a>

<p>
    Choose where you want to innovate and where to go with inertia.
</p>

<p>
    What do pithy quotes actually mean in practice? Eg. “Work really hard to hire
    good people”.
</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">00:30:00</a>

<p>
    The first person you hire influences 50 people that your company will hire.
</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">00:40:00</a>

<p>
    Working with the credit card companies was solved by a “business development”
    guy.
</p>

<p>
    It’s important for the CEO to by integrally involved in the micro-product
    decisions. What’s optimal on a 1-year horizon is drastially different from
    what’s optimal on a 5-year horizion.
</p>

<p>70% of Stripe’s decisons was being led by it’s customers and users.</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">00:50:00 - Intense</a>

<p>
    Stripe has a “product engineering manager” which seems to be the secret sauce to
    their success.
</p>

<p>
    Covers how it’s possible for a company to become big and maintain it’s rate of
    innovation.
</p>

<p>
    Stripe has a complicated versioning system that let’s one version of the API be
    converted to another version.
</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">01:00:00</a>

<p>
    You should generally shift from speaking to writing. 
</p>

<p>
    Speaking can only happen once. Writing persists throught time. It can be updated
    an revisited.
</p>

<p>
    Writing is easier to dissect than anecdotes.
</p>

<a class="timestamp_float_left">01:10:00</a>

<p>
    Three things the CEO should focus on:
    <ol>
        <li>Strategy</li>
        <li>Culture</li>
        <li>Selecting senior management</li>
        <li>(optional) Product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> How to Start a Startup 11 : Hiring and Culture with Patrick and John
        Collison and Ben Silbermann (2014)</h2>

    <p class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTS7OIAMunM</p>

    <a class="timestamp_float_left">00:00:00</a>

    <p>
        BS: If you are aligned with the mission and have access to information
        which gives you an idea about the current state of the company, it helps
        build a productive culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        BS: As you become big (50+ people), you can’t be involved with every
        aspect of the product.  Culture is the invariant which helps you in this
        regard.
    </p>

    <p>
        BS: People think that culture is like architecture, however it’s a lot
        like gardening. You have to maintain it and pull out the weeds.
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: The first 10 people you’re hiring are going to be top quality. So
        they’ll probably have their peers vehemently discouraging them. 
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: If they’re already at Facebook or Google, it’s difficult to hire
        them. Hire the 18 y/o undiscovered talent instead.
    </p>

    <a class="timestamp_float_left">00:10:00</a>

    <p>
        PC: Advice is very limited experience, wildly over-extrapolated.
    </p>

    <p>
        PC: Your first hires should be genuine and straight. Trustworth and have
        intellectual honesty. Excited about getting things finished.
    </p>

    <p>
        PC: They should care a great deal. Something being even slightly off is
        offensive to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        PC: Three traits: 
        <ol>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Caring a great deal</li>
            <li>Completing thing</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        BS: The really good people are generally doing something else. So you’ll
        have to seek them out. They won’t seek you out.
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: Have an elevator pitch for potential recruits.
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: When interviewing for positions outside of you’re expertise, ask
        them to do a project related to you’re company. That way you have a
        reference point in an area you have no idea aboout.
    </p>

    <a class="timestamp_float_left">00:20:00</a>

    <p>
        PC: It’s pretty hard to fake it for a week.
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: When asking for references, ask the referrer “Where would you rank
        this person amongst the people you’ve worked with in this role?” 
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: Get people working on real problems on the very first day. Quickly
        give them feedback to help them adapt to the culture.
    </p>

    <a class="timestamp_float_left">00:30:00</a>

    <p>
        PC: Stripe has 3 meals everyday on long tables where everyone can sit
        together.  This increases the net human interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        PC: In a startup, you can afford to have complete transparency. This is
        a luxury you lose when you become big. You’re subject to the scrutiy of
        the entire organization. This is the tradeoff to the advantage that
        everyone is much more informed.
    </p>

    <p>
        JC: You have to create norms to when employees can jump in to
        conversations that are taking place on IRC or Slack between other
        employees.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every single leader of a project gives a 30 minute talk on what their
        project is doing and how you can contribute if you’re interested.
    </p>

    <a class="timestamp_float_left">00:40:00</a>

    <p>
        BS: As the CEO of Pinterest, looking at what people have hand-picked has
        had a tremendous influence on the overall vision of the company. This is
        extremely valuable data.
