            <h1>Product Pillars</h1>

                
            <p>
                When you are in the flow of designing a website, it is easy to gradually make small decisions that go
                against the overall design goal you have for the site. These small mistakes add up to make a product
                completely orthogonal to what you had originally intended. Breaking out of this specific form of tunnel
                vision doesn't always happen. To help avoid ending up in such a situation, we follow <strong>product
                pillars</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Product pillars are guiding principles that you consult when designing your website. They are the
                foundation on which you build your website upon and help ensure that the features you feel are important
                make their way to the final version of your site.
            </p>

            <h2>Lightweight Page</h2>

            <p>
                If the intention is to make a page that works on 2G networks, then using even two fonts in their woff
                formats can add upto 250 kilobytes to the page size. This happens when different requests go for
                different weights and styles of the fonts. For 2G networks, it is best to avoid using fonts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lightweight page examples:
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><a>https://www.reddit.com/.mobile</a></li>
                    <li><a>https://news.ycombinator.com</a></li>
                    <li><a>https://lite.cnn.com.</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                These web pages load on a 2G network connection running at 64 kbps (8 kilobytes/sec). They don't load
                additional fonts. A reddit thread with 400+ comments has a page size of 25 kiB.
            </p>

            <p>
                A web page can have lines of JavaScript and CSS and still be lightweight as these don't affect page
                sizes as much as fonts do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Requirements for a lightweight web page
                <ol>
                    <li>No fonts</li>
                    <li>No images</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
