                        I guess my most impactful project was a microprocessor-based weather station
                        for siting wind energy systems and fruit frost prediction in the early 1980s.
                        Turned out that one of my stations, being used by a frost predictor, was across
                        the street from a rural drainage ditch in which a young child was discovered
                        face down in the water. The frost predictor faxed temperature profiles for the
                        previous several hours to the hospital, where doctors determined the child
                        could be revived. She was.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                        During a centralisation of public school local servers to a data centre, I
                        created a consolidated library enquiry system. It served over 2,000 libraries,
                        had 330 million titles, and had about a million users. It was efficient enough
                        to run off my laptop, if need be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        AFAIK it was one of the top five biggest library systems in the world at the
                        time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I was asked to add some features that would have been too difficult in the old
                        distributed system. Things like reading competitions, recommended reading lists
                        by age, etc…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I watched the effect of these changes — which took me mere days of effort to
                        implement — and the combined result was that students read about a million
                        additional books they would not have otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I’ve had a far greater effect on the literacy of our state than any educator by
                        orders of magnitude and hardly anyone in the department of education even knows
                        my name!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This was the project that made realise how huge the effort-to-effect ratio that
                        can be when computers are involved…

                        Easy zero-setup of DSL modem before some BellCore decided to complicate things
                        (thus exploding their field deployment budgets; Southwestern Bell/Qwest enjoyed
                        our profitable zero-setup). Sold to Siemens.

                        <p>
                        First job out of college, I was at a consulting firm doing software development
                        for DHS (Homeland Security). I got a lot of flack from my friends and family
                        for “working for the devil”, but the work was actually objectively good for
                        society - basically there was a big data problem where when an immigrant trying
                        to illegally cross into the US was apprehended, and if they were sick, their
                        custody would be transferred from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to
                        Health and Human Services (HHS) so they could receive medical attention. There
                        was zero data transparency between these two orgs, so when that transfer
                        happened it usually caused families to be separated (Sick dad, healthy mom and
                        child, sick dad gets brought in for care and never finds his family again).
                        Since HHS and CBP don’t have data communication and everything is siloed, the
                        handoff was really poor and they often wouldn’t find each other for months
                        afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There was a lot of talk about this in the news, and although the software I was
                        working on didn’t entirely fix the problem, it allowed the agencies to
                        communicate better. Their data wasn’t siloed, and families got separated for
                        only a few days rather than (sometimes) permanently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I really miss that job. The pay was atrocious and zero WLB, but everyone agreed
                        it was an important problem to solve, and I think the tool we had built really
                        was helping.
