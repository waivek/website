                <div>
                        I guess my most impactful project was a microprocessor-based weather station
                        for siting wind energy systems and fruit frost prediction in the early 1980s.
                        Turned out that one of my stations, being used by a frost predictor, was across
                        the street from a rural drainage ditch in which a young child was discovered
                        face down in the water. The frost predictor faxed temperature profiles for the
                        previous several hours to the hospital, where doctors determined the child
                        could be revived. She was.

                    <p>
                        First job out of college, I was at a consulting firm doing software development
                        for DHS (Homeland Security). I got a lot of flack from my friends and family
                        for "working for the devil", but the work was actually objectively good for
                        society - basically there was a big data problem where when an immigrant trying
                        to illegally cross into the US was apprehended, and if they were sick, their
                        custody would be transferred from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to
                        Health and Human Services (HHS) so they could receive medical attention. There
                        was zero data transparency between these two orgs, so when that transfer
                        happened it usually caused families to be separated (Sick dad, healthy mom and
                        child, sick dad gets brought in for care and never finds his family again).
                        Since HHS and CBP don't have data communication and everything is siloed, the
                        handoff was really poor and they often wouldn't find each other for months
                        afterwards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a lot of talk about this in the news, and although the software I was
                        working on didn't entirely fix the problem, it allowed the agencies to
                        communicate better. Their data wasn't siloed, and families got separated for
                        only a few days rather than (sometimes) permanently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really miss that job. The pay was atrocious and zero WLB, but everyone agreed
                        it was an important problem to solve, and I think the tool we had built really
                        was helping.
