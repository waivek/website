<dl>Theme              </dl><dd>In contemporary literary studies, a theme is the central topic a text treats.</dd>
<dl>Shot composition   </dl><dd>In cinematography, composition refers to the frame of the image and how the elements of the mise-en-scène appear in it. Composition guidelines must be observed when telling stories visually, as in filmmaking.</dd>
<dl>Mise-en-scene      </dl><dd>Mise-en-scène is an expression used to describe the design aspect of a theatre or film production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "telling a story"—both in visually artful ways through storyboarding, cinematography and stage design, and in poetically artful ways through direction.</dd>
<dl>Set design         </dl><dd>Scenic design is the creation of theatrical, as well as film or television scenery. Scenic designers come from a variety of artistic backgrounds, but in recent years, are mostly trained professionals, holding a B.F.A. or M.F.A. degrees in theater arts.</dd>
<dl>Script             </dl><dd>A screenplay, or script, is a written work by screenwriters for a film, television program or video game.

<dl>Camera movement    </dl><dd>In intentional camera movement, a camera is moved during the exposure for a creative or artistic effect. This causes the image points to move across the recording medium, producing an apparent streaking in the resulting image.</dd>
<dl>Acting             </dl><dd>Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.</dd>
<dl>Sound mixing       </dl><dd>Audio mixing is the process by which multiple sounds are combined into one or more channels. In the process, a source’s volume level, frequency content, dynamics, and panoramic position are manipulated and or enhanced.</dd>
<dl>Blocking           </dl><dd>Blocking in theater and film. In contemporary theater, the director usually determines blocking during rehearsal, telling actors where they should move for the proper dramatic effect, ensure sight lines for the audience and work with the lighting design of the scene.</dd>
<dl>Lighting           </dl><dd>Lighting or illumination is the deliberate use of light to achieve a practical or aesthetic effect. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight.</dd>

<dl>Editing            </dl><dd>Film editing is both a creative and a technical part of the post-production process of filmmaking. The term is derived from the traditional process of working with film which increasingly involves the use of digital technology.</dd>
<dl>Special effects    </dl><dd>Special effects are illusions or visual tricks used in the film, television, theatre, video game and simulator industries to simulate the imagined events in a story or virtual world. Special effects are traditionally divided into the categories of optical effects and mechanical effects.</dd>

<dl>Symbolism          </dl><dd>Symbolism was a late nineteenth-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts. In literature, the style originates with the 1857 publication of Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du mal.</dd>
<dl>Mood               </dl><dd>In literature, mood is the atmosphere of the narrative. Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions.</dd>
