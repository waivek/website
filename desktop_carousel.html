                <p>
                    Naruto (ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells
                    the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent ninja who searches for recognition from his peers and the
                    village and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is in two
                    parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on
                    two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
                    Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

                <h4>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h4>
                <p>
                    Avatar: The Last Airbender (Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions) is an American animated
                    television series that aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon. The series began in February 2005 and
                    concluded in July 2008 with a two-hour episode titled Sozin's Comet. Avatar: The Last Airbender is
                    set in an Asiatic-like world in which some people can manipulate the classical elements with
                    psychokinetic variants of the Chinese martial arts known as "bending". The series is presented in a
                    style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the imagery of East/South Asian,
                    Inuit, and New World societies. It follows the protagonist, 12-year-old Aang and his friends, who
                    must bring peace and unity to the world by ending the Fire Lord's war with three nations.
