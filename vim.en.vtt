00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.380
Hey guys!!

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.660
Welcome to Blackode Vim Daily Tips

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.660
Today tip will solve the problem of copying

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660
at certain position, going

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.660
for beyond another position

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.660
pasting, ...... so,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660
If you are doing this means, stop

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.660
immediately and use our tip

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.660
we go little bit practical.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660
Here, I open my practice file

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.660
The file consists nothing interesting

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.660
just created to understand what's going on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660
while we are executing the commands

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.660
Ok, so I want to

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
copy lines from one to five and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
have to paste them after fifth 5th

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660
line, so , if  our

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.660
command works well, no surprise the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660
lines from 1 to 5 are copied beneath the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.660
line 5

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.660
So, lets do that. What you have to do is

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.660
go to ex command mode by pressing : colon

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.980
and type 1,5 and t5 and +

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.480
If you parse the command

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.480
1,5 are lower and upper

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
boundaries or range of lines

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480
and t is the last

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
last letter in put

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
and 5 is the line

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
number. As you added plus + means

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
after line , if minus means

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480
above the line . So overall

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
things looks like this .

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
the range of lines from one to five

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
put them after the line number 5 five

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
This is the actual meaning of the command

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
So , lets do that in another angle.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760
Here what I am trying to do is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760
I would like to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.760
copy the current line to the end

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
of the line . So, my command

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760
is colon :

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
dot . t dollar $

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.760
so dot( .) is the current line

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.760
and you are telling that put

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
put means nothing but a copy or something.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.760
so where we have to keep is dollar $

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.760
dollar is the position , the last line

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.760
of the file

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760
simple, this is how we can do

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760
the different types of copies

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.760
you can copy with multiple range

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760
and also copy current line with (.) dot.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760
and you can give the range

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
you can do math , whatever do

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760
possible ways. So this is just

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
helps when you want to copy the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760
top 5 lines and would like to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760
copy them to just last of the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.760
file , when your file contains

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
about thousand 1000 or 10,000 lines

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760
this will be very awkward. so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760
copying going to gg and pressing

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.760
the copy yank 5 j

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
coming to shift G

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
and paste them. So this is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
all the stuff goes while if you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
are not using this tip . Hope this tip

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.800
helps you apart

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
