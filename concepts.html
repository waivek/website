    <div>
    <p>I want to get better at video game development, but I don't put in the effort. Instead, I watch YouTube videos. I don't feel happy when doing that. My body doesn't have free will. Viewing it as a mechanical contraption doing simple tasks is more accurate than gathering the will power to work.</p>

<h2 onclick="this.classList.toggle('collapsed')">Learning from Tutorials</h2>
    <div>
    <p>The <q>Humane Rigging</q> tutorial is a good tutorial. It explains the thought process behind each step and aims to develop a way of thinking. A good tutorial is the only way to growth. To augment a good tutorial, a reliable method of learning is necessary. With humane rigging, I write notes quickly at as close to the speed of the video as possible. Then I view the video again and solidify the notes. The first viewing is to soak in the way of thinking and the second is to clear up holes in my knowledge I wasn't aware of.</p>
    </div>
<h2 onclick="this.classList.toggle('collapsed')">Level of Life</h2>
    <div>
    <p>The level of my life when I'm not working has an effect on the length of my work. If I have decided to make Maggi or binge videos after I finish a certain task, I will rush the task. By rushing the task, I am at a net zero. I'm not good at quickly absorbing information. The presence of an attractive level of life at the end of my task incentivizes me to absorb information. <span class="grammar">This results in me completing the task on the surface, but not in me growing from my efforts.</span> I have to remind myself of how much I want to grow to counter my desire for a short-term improvement in my level of life.</p>
