<h2 id="elementary_rules_of_usage">
Elementary Rules of Usage</h2>
<h3 id="form_the_possessive">
    Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding &rsquo;s</h3>
<p>
Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Charles&rsquo;s friend</li>
        <li>Burns&rsquo;s poems</li>
        <li>the witch&rsquo;s malice</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names ending in -es and -is, the possessive of <em>Jesus&rsquo;</em>,
and such forms as for <em>conscience&rsquo; sake, for righteousness&rsquo; sake</em>. But such forms as <em>Moses&rsquo;
Laws, Isis&rsquo; temple</em> are commonly replaced by</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the law of Moses</li>
        <li>the temple of Isis</li>
    </ul>
<p>
The pronominal possessives of <em>hers, its, theirs, yours,</em> and <em>ours</em> have no apostrophe. Indefinite
pronoun, however, ues the apostrophe to show possesssion.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one&rsquo;s rights</li>
        <li>somebody else&rsquo;s umbrella</li>
    </ul>
<p>
A common error is to write <em>it&rsquo;s</em> for <em>its</em>, or vice versa. The first is a contraction, meaning
&lsquo;it is&rsquo;. The second is a possessive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It&rsquo;s a wise dog that scratches its own fleas.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="in_a_series">
    In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.</h3>
<p>
Thus write,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>red, white , and blue</li>
        <li>gold, silver, or copper</li>
        <li>He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents</li>
    </ul>
<p>
This comma is often referred to as the &lsquo;serial&rsquo; comma.</p>
<p>
In the names of business firms the last comma is usually omitted. Follow the usage of the individual firm.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Little, Brown and Company</li>
        <li>Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette</li>
    </ul>
<h3 id="enclose_parenthetic_expressions">
    Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as <em>however</em>, or a
brief phrase is or is not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the commas may be
safely omitted. But whether the interruption is slight or considerable, never omit one comma and leave the other. There
is no defence for such punctuation as</p>
<ul>
    <li>Marjorie&rsquo;s husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday</li>
    <li>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures. Punctuate as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>February to July, 1992</li>
    <li>April 6, 1986</li>
    <li>Wednesday, November 14, 1990</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that it is customary to omit the comma in</p>
<ul>
    <li>6 April 1988</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last form is an excellent way to write a date; the figures are separated by a word and are, for that reason, quickly
grasped.</p>
<p>
A name or title in direct address is parenthetic</p>
<ul>
    <li>If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.</li>
    <li>Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The abbreviations <em>etc., i.e.,</em> and <em>e.g.</em>, the abbreviations for academic degrees, and titles that follow
a name are parenthetic and should be punctuated accordingly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Letters, packages, etc., should go here.</li>
    <li>Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided</li>
    <li>The Reverend Harry Lang, S.J.</li>
</ul>
<p>
No comma, however, should separate a noun from a restrictive term of identification</p>
<ul>
    <li>Billy the Kid</li>
    <li>The novelist Jane Austen</li>
    <li>The poet Sappho</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although <em>Junior</em>, with it's abbreviation <em>Jr.,</em> has commonly been regarded as parenthetic, logic suggests
that it is, in fact, restrictive and therefore not in need of a comma.
<ul>
    <li>James Wright Jr.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nonrestrictive relative clauses are parenthetic, as are similar clauses introduced by conjunction indicating time or
place. Commas are therefore needed. A nonrestrictive clause is one that does not serve to identify or define the
antecedent noun.
<ul>
    <li>The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.</li>
    <li>In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.</li>
    <li>Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote <em>The Rime of the Ancient Martner,</em> is a few miles from Bridgewater</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these sentences, the clauses introduced by <em>which, when,</em> and <em>where</em> are nonrestrictive; they do not
limit or define, they merely add something. In the first example, the clause introduced by <em>which</em> does not serve
to tell which of the several possible audiences is meant; the reader presumably knows that already. The clauses add,
parenthetically, a statement supplementing that in the main clause. Each of the three sentences is a combination of two
statements that might have been made independently.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more interested.</li>
    <li>Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.</li>
    <li>Coleridge wrote <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> at Nether Stowey. Nether Stowey is a few miles from Bridgewater</li>
</ul>
<p>
Restrictive clauses, by contrast, are not parenthetic are not set off by commas. Thus,</p>
<ul>
    <li>People who live in glass houses shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here the clause introduced by <em>who</em> does serve to tell which people are meant; the sentence, unlike the sentences
above, cannot be split into two independent statements. The same principle of comma use applies to particular phrases
and appositives.
<ul>
    <li>People sitting in the rear couldn&rsquo;t hear. (<em>restrictive</em>)</li>
    <li>Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward. (<em>non-restrictive</em>)</li>
    <li>My cousin Bob is a talented harpist. (<em>restrictive</em>)</li>
    <li>Our oldest cousin, Mary, sings. (<em>non-restrictive</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the main clause of a sentence is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate clause, use a comma to set off these
elements.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the possession of Sicily.</li>
</ul>
