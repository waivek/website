        <h1>Bullet Points</h1>
        <p>Items—known as “bullet points”—may be short phrases, single sentences, or of paragraph length. Bulleted items
        are not usually terminated with a full stop unless they are complete sentences. In some cases, however, the
        style guide for a given publication may call for every item except the last one in each bulleted list to be
        terminated with a semicolon, and the last item with a full stop. It is correct to terminate any bullet point
        with a full stop if the text within that item consists of one full sentence or more. Bullet points are usually
        used to highlight list elements.</p>

        <ul>

        <li>    The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow.
                Typical word processor software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors. Several regular symbols,
                such as * (asterisk), - (hyphen), . (period), and even o (lowercase O), are conventionally used in
                ASCII-only text or other environments where bullet characters are not available. Historically, the index
                symbol ☞ (representing a hand with a pointing index finger) was popular for similar uses.</li>

        <li>    Lists made with bullets are called bulleted lists. The HTML element name for a bulleted list is
                “unordered list”, because the list items are not arranged in numerical order (as they would be in a
                numbered list). Usually, bullet points are used to list things.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The bullet is often used for separating menu items, usually in the footer menu. It is common, for example, to
        see it in latest website designs and in many WordPress themes. It is also used by text editors, like Microsoft
        Word, to create lists.</p>
