                <p>Dr Piotr Wozniak, February, 1999 (updated)</p>
                <div><a href="/web/20190409000238/https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/history">New article by Dr. Piotr Wozniak: The true history of spaced repetition</a></div>
                <div>This article will help you overcome one of the greatest difficulties you will face when trying to accelerate learning: formulating knowledge</div>
                    <p>The speed of learning will depend on the way you formulate the
                    material. The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated! The
                    difference in speed can be stunning!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The rules are listed in the order of importance. Those listed first
                    are most often violated or bring most benefit if complied with!</p>
                    <p>There is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with
                    learning using spaced repetition, i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat
                    the material optimally (as in <a href="/web/20190409000238/https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro">SuperMemo</a>).</p>
                    <p><strong>The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning</strong>
                    </p><ol>
                        <li><strong>Do
                                not learn if you do not understand</strong><p>Trying
                            to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing
                            proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other
                            choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination
                            deadlines are unmovable. </p>
                            <p>If you
                            are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German.
                            The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such
                            "blind learning" is astronomical. Even more important: The value
                            of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you
                            will still know nothing of history.</p>
                            <p>The German history book example is an extreme. However,
                            the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to
                            blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning
                            process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you
                            believe "it will be useful some day". &nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Learn before you
                                memorize</strong><p>Before you proceed with
                            memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to <strong>build an overall picture of
                                the learned knowledge</strong>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single
                            coherent structure, will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is
                            closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned in <a href="#Do not learn if you do not understand">Rule 1: Do not learn if you do
                                not understand</a>. A single separated piece of your picture is like a single German word
                            in the textbook of history.</p>
                            <p>Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First
                            read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g. <em>the principles of the
                                internal combustion engine</em>). Only then proceed with learning using individual
                            questions and answers (e.g. <em>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</em>),
                            etc. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Build upon the
                                basics</strong><p>The picture of the learned whole
                            (as discussed in <a href="#Learn before you memorize">Rule 2: Learn before you
                                memorize</a>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the
                            simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better.
                            Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them later
                            on.</p>
                            <p>Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious
                            things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost
                            of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time
                            repeating just 3-5% of the learned material [<a href="/web/20190409000238/https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/articles/theory">source</a>]! Basics are
                            usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each
                            memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Stick to the minimum information principle</strong><p>The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is
                            </p><ul>
                                <li><strong>Simple is easy</strong><br>
                                    By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its
                                    simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process it always in the same way. Imagine a
                                    labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through
                                    a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through
                                    the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique
                                    way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run
                                    may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to
                                    find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections
                                    being activated at each repetition of complex material</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</strong><br>
                                    I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition
                                    intervals (as in <a href="/web/20190409000238/https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro">SuperMemo</a>). If you consider an item
                                    that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent
                                    enough to keep the more difficult item in memory. If you split the complex item into
                                    sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced
                                    students create items that could easily be split into <b> ten or more</b> simpler
                                    sub-items!
                                    Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will
                                    usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item
                                    again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually
                                    remembering it only in part!</li>
                            </ul>

                        learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is
                        brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long
                        perspective, i.e. <strong>the longer the time you need to remember
                            knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your
                            items</strong>!</p>
                        <p>Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note
                        also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to
                        be retrieved from memory in a single repetition! <b>We want answer to be as

                        ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For
                        example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may
                        forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding
                        396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding
                        more questions or making the present ones more precise. </p>

                        <li><strong>Use imagery</strong><p>Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are
                            interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we
                            say <em>one picture is worth a thousand words</em>. Indeed if you look at the number of
                            details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you
                            will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the
                            visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of
                            information is usually far less volatile.</p>
                            <p>Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple
                            question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you
                            will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning
                            material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as
                            anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.</p>
                            <p>The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind
                            maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its
                            components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.</p>

                                        techniques</strong><p>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make
                                    remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a
                                    10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young
                                    genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that
                                    make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and
                                    do not require any special skills!</p>
                                    <p>Before you start believing that mastering such techniques
                                    will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the
                                    true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing
                                    knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for
                                    months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need <a href="/web/20190409000238/https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro">SuperMemo</a>  and the compliance with the 20
                                    rules presented herein.</p>
                                    <p>There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic
                                    techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can
                                    search the web for keywords such as: <em>mind maps, peg lists</em>, <em>mnemonic
                                        techniques</em>, etc.</p>
                                    <p>Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need
                                    to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using
                                    mnemonic techniques will become automatic!</p>

                                        as good as cloze deletion</strong><p>Graphic deletion
                                    works like <a href="#Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</a> but instead of a
                                    missing phrase it uses a missing image component. For example, when learning anatomy, you
                                    might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing. The
                                    student's job is to name the missing area. The same illustration can be used to formulate
                                    10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image. Graphic
                                    deletion works great in learning geography!</p>

                                            objects. For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach.
                                            A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks
                                            for the list of the members of a set. For example: <em>What countries
                                                belong to the European Union?</em> You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost
                                            of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always
                                            try to convert them into <a href="#Enumerations">enumerations</a>. Enumerations
                                            are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the
                                            EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the
                                            great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the
                                            brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more
                                            information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to
                                            remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the <a href="#minimum information principle">minimum information principle</a>: <strong>you
                                                should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</strong>.
                                            In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous
                                            effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five
                                            members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this
                                            claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go
                                            around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often.
                                            For that reason: <strong>Avoid sets! </strong>If
                                            you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use <a href="#Enumerations">techniques for dealing with enumerations</a></p>

                                                enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence
                                                C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not

                                                uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme
                                                and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze

                                        <li><strong>Combat interference</strong><p>When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For
                                            example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words <em>historic
                                            </em>and <em>historical</em>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of
                                            numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes
                                            it harder to remember another item, we have a case of <strong>memory interference</strong>.
                                            You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you
                                            memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example,
                                            if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela,
                                            Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with
                                            just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the
                                            location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will
                                            suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting.
                                            In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.</p>
                                            <p>Interference is probably the single greatest cause of
                                            forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when
                                            it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to <strong>detect and
                                                eliminate</strong>. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict
                                            interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between
                                            remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman
                                            and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It
                                            very hard to predict.</p>
                                            <p>Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it
                                            takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable.
                                            Here are some tips:</p>

                                                <li>eliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes
                                                    your obsession (e.g. as soon as you see the word <strong><em>inept</em></strong>
                                                    you think "<em>I know the meanings of <strong>inept</strong>

                                            can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference. In the
                                            example below, using the words <em>humble</em> and <em>supplicant</em> helps the student
                                            focus on the word <em>shamelessly</em> and thus strengthen the correct semantics. Better
                                            focus helps eliminating interference. Secondly, the use of the words <em>humble</em> and <em>supplicant</em>
                                            makes it possible to avoid interference of <em>cringing </em>with these words themselves.
                                            Finally, the proposed wording is shorter and more specific. Naturally, the rules <a href="#Build upon the basics">basics-to-details</a> and <a href="#Do not learn if you do not understand">do not learn what you do not
                                                understand</a> require that the words <em>humble</em> and <em>supplicant</em> be learned

                                                    item starting from the label <em>bioch</em> which puts your brain immediately in the right

                                                            Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g. <i>Watch out!, Other

                                                            personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping
                                                            or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you
                                                            might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is
                                                            enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can
                                                            update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize
                                                            knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in

                                                            itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP
                                                            figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</p>
