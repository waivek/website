Sold for an aspiring live sound engineer, has much more than just advice for live sound guys - covering everything from microphones to acoustics to basic electronics to handy rules of thumb to MIDI, all written to be relentlessly pragmatic. It even has a handy appendix covering logarithms.</p><p>This isn't the book to give you the final "20%" of knowledge on anything it covers - but it will help you on your way to the first 80% a lot more quickly than most other writing on anything related to semi/pro audio, and pretty much every expert in the field is at least familiar with it, if they don't own a copy.</p><p>There seem to be plenty of people interested in music and audio around here, so hopefully someone finds the unusual reference useful.

                <h2>Success</h2>
                <div class="link">
                    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18118498">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18118498</a>

                At one time I thought highly successful people would be more like each other than less successful people.  I believed it even more when it was explained as the Anna Karenina principle.  But my experience hasn't borne it out.  There are many things you can point to as advantages or "best practices" but in the end it all seems to dissolve into our penchant for telling stories.  One guy is successful because he was born into it, it's all he saw growing up, every element was demonstrated for him and instilled in him as normal his whole life.  Another guy is successful because he was born with nothing and had to fight for every little thing, and he kept fighting for the next thing until he had a whole company.  These are both coherent stories, but they don't explain the difference between those two and all the other people who were born to success but reverted to the mean or who were born into poverty and stayed there.<p>I've seen people succeed with vastly different, contradictory strategies.  I've seen engineers promoted to management earn respect by getting in the weeds and doing unwanted grunt work, and I've seen engineers promoted to management stay so hands-off from technical stuff that new employees assumed they were MBAs who didn't understand the work they were managing.  I've seen people with humble origins flaunt them at every opportunity and others all but deny them.  I've seen people who immersed themselves in detail to see the whole picture and people who carefully rationed the information they consumed to avoid being overwhelmed, systematically delegating the responsibility for details.</p><p>Conclusion:  that's the wrong way to try to understand the difference between luck and skill.  Suppose you ran a huge experiment where you had 1000 chess grandmasters, 1000 masters, 1000 good amateurs, and so on down to 1000 chronic duffers, and they each inherited a thousand games starting at move eight (crediting the first seven moves to luck, circumstances, and childhood.)  You wouldn't learn much by asking whether the winners attacked or defended, opened the middle or jammed it up, preferred their knights or their bishops.  Those aren't the right questions.  A grandmaster doesn't move a knight just because she likes knights, or because moving knights is the baller thing that all the grandmasters do.  It's because it accomplishes something in their situation.  If life was a game you could play over and over again, with executive control gradually fading in starting in the teenage years, a brilliant player might play each lifetime very differently.  It's an interesting thought experiment to ask what skills you would develop as you "played" dozens or hundreds of lifetimes!  Certainly not rigid rules like "wake up at 5am" or "wear the same thing every day."

                    <p>Here's my advice for hardcore learning:</p>
<p>Seek out grammar resources (in print or online). Read through one or two of them to confirm that you have a complete,
if basic, understanding of tense, punctuation, mood, etc.</p>

<p>Begin a regular reading schedule. Optimally, you should read one poem, one short story, and one essay each day. You
should seek out classic and contemporary works that challenge your reading level. You should read each piece critically
to understand how and why they work. You will absorb a great deal this way. Even with an average reading speed, this
will take only 1.5&mdash;2 hours per day and will positively impact your entire life. Read widely. Read things you
normally wouldn't. Read what's popular. Read what's critically acclaimed. Read what's famously bad (to find out
why).</p>

<p>Begin a regular writing schedule. The ideal time to write is in the morning, before your other obligations begin. If
you customarily rise at 6 AM to prepare for work, rise at 4 AM or 5 AM instead, write for 1 or 2 hours, and continue as
normal, going to bed that much earlier. Even with an average typing speed, you will, with practice, bang out 1000-2000
words in a couple hours. Every week, you will be able to produce first drafts for 1 to 2 short stories. Make that the
goal: one decent first draft each week, or two if you're really keen.</p>

<p>Focus on short stories for the first two years. Short stories allow you to experiment with new techniques quickly.
After two years, you'll have produced at least a hundred first drafts for short stories, some of which will be pretty
good. Some of them will even be about the same set of characters, like a proto novel.</p>

<p>Set time aside to reread and edit your old work. After two years of practice, your idea of what constitutes quality
writing will have changed. But only now will you have the training to make meaningful edits! Some of the stories will be
garbage, but many will be rough gems.</p>

<p>At the end of this two-year period, you will be able to call yourself a beginner writer.</p>

<p>People always recommend "Elements of Style" by Strunk and White. This is an okay book. It's really basic, really
simple. That's the reason it's so popular - no nuance. It will advance a flawed writer to a decent writer. But it won't
make a decent writer into a good writer.</p>

<p>If you want to take it to the next level, I highly recommend "Syntax as Style" by Virginia Tufte. This is, by far,
the best book on grammar and style out there.</p>

<p>Honestly, the best way to improve grammar is to read and write. A lot. But a couple books on syntax can't hurt.</p>

<p>If you want a third recommendation, try "How to Write a Sentence", by Fisher.</p>

                    <h2>Bryan Garner & Writing</h2>

                    <p>“I realized early—at the age of 15—that my primary intellectual interest was the use of the English language. The interest might be partly genetic. My grandfather, Frank Garner of Amarillo, had more than a passing interest in language. This was magnified three or four times in my father, Gary T. Garner of Canyon, a true language aficionado. And then, as my father tells it, his interest seemed to be magnified a hundredfold in me. It became an all-consuming passion.</p>
                    <p>“This passion has taken various forms at different times in my life. At 15 it consisted primarily in building my vocabulary. Then I discovered general semantics—the works of S.I. Hayakawa, Wendell Johnson, Stuart Chase, and Alfred Korzybski. Because I grew up in a university town—small though it was—these and other books were readily accessible. I read everything I could find on the subject.</p>
                    <p>“Then, on a wintry evening while visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered Eric Partridge‘s <em>Usage and Abusage</em>. I was enthralled. Never had I held a more exciting book. I spent hours reading his advice on the effective use of words and his essays on everything from Johnsonese to précis writing. He kept mentioning another author, by the name of Fowler, so when I got back to Texas I sought out Fowler’s <em>Modern English Usage</em>. And that book turned out to be even better.</p>
                    <p>“Suffice it to say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to memory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors: the Evanses, Bernstein, Follett, and Copperud. I knew where they differed, and I came to form opinions about whose positions were soundest on all sorts of questions. I knew the work of those writers then better than I do today.  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">“College presented a wealth of opportunities. While at the University of Texas, I studied the history of the English language and the Latin and Greek element in English, as well as Latin and French.</span></p>
                    <p>“Though I never mastered Old English, I acquired a passing knowledge of the Middle English of Chaucer and Gower. Two summers at Oxford University—where I studied Chaucer and T.S. Eliot—deepened my appreciation of how language and literature intersect. It was at Oxford that I first got to know Robert W. Burchfield, the editor of the Supplement to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (then underway), and Christopher Ricks, one of the great modern literary critics.”</p>
                    <p>“While at Texas and Oxford, I attended many lectures by noted linguists who were dogmatically descriptive in their approach. The most bothersome thing to me was that they didn‘t write well: their offerings were dreary gruel. So I gravitated away from the Linguistics Department and toward English and Classics. My mentors were John W. Velz, a Shakespearean of the first rank, and Thomas Cable, whose history of the English language (with Albert Baugh) is a classic. So while I was still in college emboldened by Professor Velz&#8217;s assurances that my work was worthy of publication, I knew that I would one day write a book in my favorite genre: a dictionary of usage.”</p>
